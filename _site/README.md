## Jekyll data post convention
Save your Jekyll data post files in the following format (refer to post dir for examples):

* Filename convention: "YYYY-MM-DD-full_name.markdown"
* This is the minimun necessary front matter:
  * "---" 
  * "title: post_title"
  * "location: file_location_in_google_drive"
  * "fileName: file_name"
  * "layout: post" (keep this standard)
  * "categories: post_category_1 post_category_2"
  * "---"
* Then include your post content, a brief description of the dataset

## Jekyll Site Information

Templates for individual page layouts live in the _Layouts directory

The homepage is is _layouts/data 

Post styling on individual data pages (e.g. https://openoakland.github.io/woaq/transportation/2018/04/17/prohibited_truck_routes_edf_spatial.html) is handled by _layouts/data 

You will probably want to customize/override default CSS at some stage. Please DO NOT edit the default css in the assets/minima directory. This would put us out of step with the default and make future upgrades to the site difficult. Instead, just add your work to assets/main.scss. This will import the latest from our default theme and let you work on top of that. Please ask Robert if you have any questions.
