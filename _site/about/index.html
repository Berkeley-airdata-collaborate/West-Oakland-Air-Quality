    <p>This project is in support of an environmental justice group in West Oakland, the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project (WOEIP).</p>

<p>WOEIP has been advocating for cleaner air in their community since the early 00’s.</p>

<p>Read more about air quality issues in West Oakland: https://www.edf.org/airqualitymaps/pollution-and-health-concerns-west-oakland</p>

<p>Also have a look at EDF’s policy proposals to get a sense of the agenda:
https://www.edf.org/airqualitymaps/policies-reduce-pollution-and-protect-health</p>

<p>A key component of their strategy has been citizen science approaches to monitoring air quality. They have low-cost sensors that they provide to residents for guided air quality tours of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The citizen science approach serves two goals:
Involves the community in air quality issues, helps with education and mobilization
Provides an independent check on data coming from the City and the Port</p>

<p>Over the years, a lot of air quality data has been collected both by WOEIP but by other partners at EDF and elsewhere. In addition, there are various other studies that have been conducted on health impacts, truck counts through West Oakland neighborhoods, etc. Existing data on topics like land use and zoning, idling citations, community resources like schools and the senior center would also be useful in developing a picture of the issue.  Unfortunately, this data is scattered all over and not managed or stored in a way that is usable. Previous efforts by outside volunteers and researchers working with WOEIP have not been successful at building the organization’s capacity or infrastructure use this data themselves or with assistance from technical partners.</p>
